# Text File Lower Case Converter

This Python utility is designed to convert the text in a given file to lowercase. It can be particularly useful when you want to standardize the case of words in a text document.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the source code to your local environment.

2. Open the `words-lowercase.py` file.

3. Modify the `nome_arquivo_entrada` variable to specify the path to your input text file.

4. Modify the `nome_arquivo_saida` variable to specify the path and name of the output file where the converted text will be saved.

5. Run the script by executing the Python file (`words-lowercase.py`).

6. Upon completion, the converted text will be saved in the specified output file.

## Folder Structure

- The **[Input](./input/)** folder contains a sample input text file named `in.txt`.
- The **[Output](./output/)** folder is where the converted text will be saved (default output file is `out.txt`).
- The **[Script](./script/)** folder contains the source code for the text case converter (`words-lowercase.py`).

## How It Works

The utility reads the content of the specified input file, converts all words to lowercase, and then saves the result to the specified output file.

## Note

Make sure to customize the `nome_arquivo_entrada` and `nome_arquivo_saida` variables in the Python script to match your input and output file paths.

Feel free to use this utility to standardize the case of words in your text data!
